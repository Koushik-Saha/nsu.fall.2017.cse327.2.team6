    <strong>Product Scope</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The KorbaniAnimalProvider system is composed of two components one is user
    and another is admin. Admin can upload every animal picture with details
    specification and user can sign up with name, username, email address,
    phone number and the location. User get own profile where he/she can update
    delete and modify his/her profile. User can chose any kind of animal with
    any range there is a range for money where use define what range he/she buy
    an animal. One animal have multiple buyer those case there has an auction
    who win this auction he/she can buy this animal.
</p>
<p>
    After buying an animal user have a page where user look for total money
    after adding home delivery charge and he/she can modify his/her location
    where to home delivery and how he/she pay for this money (there is multiple
    option for paying money line case on delivery or visa card or bkash). There
    is an option for Kasai, we provide different Kasai for different different
    location phone number, user can directly contact with Kosai without any
    charge.
</p>
<p>
    The benefits of this project is not to go in Goru hat to buy an animal, we
    know that our country Goru Hat is full of dirty and messy, So that we
    provide a fully noise and harassment free buying an animal online
    management system where user buy any animal sit in his/her house and there
    is no harassment it’s that simple.
</p>
<p>
    Our goal is to provide an online management system which will be not
    harmful for environment and easy process buy an animal.

<p>
    The project is meant to offer an easy and relaxing solution in the season
    of Eid-Ul-Adha for the people who find hassles to go and buy his preferable
    animal for Kurbani. And obviously, now a days everybody lives a busy life
    more or less. So it’s for them who really want to avoid the trouble, chaos,
    anxiety in cow market. The software will have little or no learning curve,
    and the user interface will be as intuitive as possible. So technical
    sagacity must not be an issue to use this software. Rather the users will
    be provided a guideline about how to use the product in particular
    situation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.4 Operating Environment</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The main component of the project is the software application which will be
    limited into Android operating system. There are no practical hardware
    constraints. Ensuring proper use of API is one of the major issue. So the
    operating environment for the project can be listed like this:
</p>
<p>
    § Distributed database
</p>
<p>
    § Customer/server system
</p>
<p>
    § OS: Windows and Android
</p>
<p>
    § Database: sql + Database
</p>
<p>
    § Platform: java/PHP
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The primary design constraint is the computer as well as mobile platform
    too. For android hand-set , limited screen size and resolution is a major
    design consideration. Another difficult challenge is to create an effective
    and easily navigable user interface. Limited memory and processing power is
    also worth considering constraint.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.6 User documentation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The primary goal of ‘Korbani Animal Provider’ software is to simplify the
    inconveniences of buying cows direct from the cattle market. So not to face
    any problems regarding the usage of the software there is surely an user
    guideline/help menu/ tutorial will be provided. From there, besides the
    directives, a customer can also get the contact info of a butcher if they
    want.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.7 Assumption and Dependencies</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It is assumed that data will be made available for the project in some
    phase of its completion. Also Since the application is a web based
    application there is a need for the internet browser. It will be assumed
    that the users will possess decent internet connectivity.

    data about system for example user, Doctor and Butcher information must be
    stored in database for later use and system functionality. MySQL database
    management system is used forthat purpose and it has nice open source user
    interface which displays table and rows in well formatted form for
    developers to create and manage the whole database.Another server that will
    be used is Google Map Server to provide geographical service and to
    visualize transportations.In terms of user interface, HTML and Bootstrap
    library will be used to illustrate the system attractively.These client and
    server sides attraction will be handledwith Http Requests by JavaScript and
    PHP Languages.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Communication Interfaces:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The system shall send automatic verification e-mail to the user who wants
    to register to the system.This a e-commerce site for product sell. When a
    customer choses a product to buy, first they will have to participate a
    beat for the product with the other customers who will also choice the same

    5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements
</h1>
<h1>
    1. Performance Requirements ::
</h1>
<p>
    Performance should not be an issue because all of our server queries
    involve small pieces of data. Changing screens will require very little
    computation and thus will occur very quickly. The performance is used by in
    application will be highly efficient, taking only a fraction of a second to
    compute.
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="_Toc441230996"></a>
    <a name="_Toc439994691"></a>
    2. Safety Requirements ::
</h2>
<p>
    <a name="_Toc441230997"></a>
    <a name="_Toc439994692"></a>
    Our software(Korbani Cow Provider) will not affect data stored outside of
    its servers nor will it affect any other applications installed on the
    user’s device. It cannot cause any damage to the computer or its internal
    components. The only potential safety concern associated with this
    application applies to virtually all handset apps or pc.
</p>
<p>
    3. <strong>Security Requirements ::</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This application assumes that only the user or whoever he/she allows will
    have access to his/her computer. With that being said, only a password is
    required to verify the identity of the user upon opening the user
    interface. This could only pose a thread if a user has set up Payment
    (Bkash etc.) functionality, however any transaction involving real currency
    must be authorized and confirmed before becoming final. The Payment API
    provides all of the security checks needed to ensure that no fraudulent
    transactions occur.
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="_Toc441230998"></a>
    <a name="_Toc439994693"></a>
    4. Software Quality Attributes ::
</h2>
<p>
    The graphical user interface of our software (Korbani Cow Provider) is to
    be designed with usability as the first priority. The software will be
    presented and organized in a manner that is both visually appealing and
    easy for the user to navigate. There will be feedbacks and visual cues such
    as notifications to inform users of updates and pop-ups to provide users
    with instructions.
</p>
<p>
    To maintain flexibility and adaptability, the software will take into
    account situations in which a user loses internet connection or for
    whatever reason cannot establish a connection with the server. These users
    will still be able to use the application, but any Bills, transactions,
    etc. posted while disconnected will be cached until the connection is
    restored.
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="_Toc441230999"></a>
    <a name="_Toc439994694"></a>
    5. Business Rules ::
</h2>
<p>
    Our software (Korbani Cow Provider) has some business rules . It won’t
    charge or cost to user for sign up or visit . After buying the product user
    have to complete the payment (Bkash etc. ) and once user buy something they
    can not return or back that product .After confirmation of the payment user
    can not ask for money back .
</p>
<p>
    Other requirement:
</p>
<p>
    A database for animals provider calls for a server side implementation that
</p>
<p>
    holds information for the users, animals , payment as well as all
</p>
<p>
    the relationships involved. The database will be using MySQL. The
</p>
<p>
    following provides an example of information that may be stored in the
</p>
<p>

    The server will be conﬁgured on a Linux platform, and through use of PHP
</p>
<p>
    will allow interaction and processing in conjunction with the database.
</p>
<p>
    Processes to be done on the server include: pushing/pulling data, updating
